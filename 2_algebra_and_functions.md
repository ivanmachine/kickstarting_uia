R1 mathematics in the Norwegian curriculum covers several foundational topics in algebra and functions. Hereâ€™s an overview of these essential principles:

### Fundamental Principles of Algebra in R1

1. **Expressions and Equations**:
   - **Algebraic Expressions**: Understanding how to manipulate and simplify algebraic expressions using basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - **Equations**: Solving linear and quadratic equations is central. This includes techniques such as factoring, using the quadratic formula, and completing the square.

2. **Polynomials**:
   - **Operations**: Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing polynomials.
   - **Factoring**: Techniques to factor polynomials, such as factoring by grouping and using special formulas like the difference of squares.
   - **Zeros/Roots**: Finding and interpreting the roots of polynomial equations, which are the solutions to \(f(x) = 0\).

3. **Inequalities**:
   - Solving linear and quadratic inequalities.
   - Representing solutions graphically on a number line and using interval notation.
   - Understanding systems of inequalities and how they define solution regions on the coordinate plane.

### Fundamental Principles of Functions in R1

1. **Basic Concepts of Functions**:
   - **Definition**: A function is a relation where each input has exactly one output.
   - **Notation**: Familiarity with function notation \(f(x)\).

2. **Types of Functions**:
   - **Linear Functions**: \(f(x) = ax + b\). Understanding slope and intercept, and how to graph these functions.
   - **Quadratic Functions**: \(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\). Ability to graph parabolas, find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and determine the direction (upward or downward) of the parabola.
   - **Exponential Functions**: Functions of the form \(f(x) = a \cdot b^x\), where \(a\) is a constant and \(b\) is the base of the exponential.

3. **Transformations of Functions**:
   - **Translation**: Shifting graphs vertically and horizontally.
   - **Scaling**: Stretching or compressing graphs vertically and horizontally.
   - **Reflection**: Flipping graphs over the x-axis or y-axis.

4. **Composite Functions**:
   - Understanding the composition of functions, denoted as \(f(g(x))\), and how to evaluate and simplify them.

5. **Inverse Functions**:
   - Finding and understanding inverse functions, included only if a function is one-to-one (bijective). The inverse "undoes" the action of the function, and graphically, it is the reflection over the line \(y = x\).

### Study Strategies

- **Practice**: Regular practice with problem-solving, such as simplifying expressions, solving equations, and graphing functions.
- **Visual Learning**: Graph functions by hand to understand transformations and the behavior of different types of functions.
- **Use Technology**: Graphing calculators or software (like GeoGebra) can help visualize functions and their transformations.
- **Conceptual Focus**: Emphasize understanding over memorization. For example, understand why certain transformations affect the graph of a function in specific ways.

By mastering these principles, you'll build a strong foundation in algebra and functions, which is critical for success in R1 mathematics and further studies in STEM fields.
