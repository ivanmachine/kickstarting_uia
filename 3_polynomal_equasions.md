R1 mathematics in the Norwegian curriculum places significant emphasis on polynomial equations and inequalities. Here's a structured approach to understanding these concepts:

### Polynomial Equations

#### Basic Concepts
- **Polynomials**: An expression consisting of variables and coefficients, involving terms in the form \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0 \).
    - **Degree**: The highest power of the variable in a polynomial. The degree helps determine the number of roots (solutions) and the shape of the graph.
  
#### Solving Polynomial Equations
1. **Linear Equations**: These are first-degree polynomial equations of the form \( ax + b = 0 \).
   - Solve by isolating \( x \): \( x = -\frac{b}{a} \).

2. **Quadratic Equations**: These are second-degree polynomials of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
   - **Factoring**: Express the quadratic as a product of two binomials, if possible, \( (px + q)(rx + s) = 0 \), then solve \( px + q = 0 \) and \( rx + s = 0 \).
   - **Quadratic Formula**: If factoring is difficult or impossible, use:
     \[
     x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - **Completing the Square**: Rearrange the quadratic into a perfect square form.

3. **Higher-Degree Polynomials**: Solving these usually involves factoring and using known roots.
   - **Synthetic Division**: A method for dividing polynomials that can simplify the process of finding roots.
   - **Rational Root Theorem**: Helps to identify potential rational roots to test.

#### Graphical Understanding
- The graph of a polynomial equation helps visualize the roots where the function crosses the x-axis.

### Polynomial Inequalities

#### Basic Concepts
- A polynomial inequality involves expressions like \( ax^2 + bx + c > 0 \).
- These inequalities describe regions on the number line where the polynomial expression is either positive, negative, or zero.

#### Solving Polynomial Inequalities
1. **Determine the Roots**: Quickly identify where a polynomial equals zero using the methods above.
   
2. **Test Intervals**: Use the roots to define intervals on the number line. Test points within each interval to determine if the polynomial is positive or negative in those regions.

3. **Sign Chart**: A sign chart can help visualize the sign changes of the polynomial across intervals.

4. **Inequality Solutions**:
   - For \( ax^2 + bx + c > 0 \), find intervals where the polynomial is positive.
   - For \( ax^2 + bx + c < 0 \), find intervals where it's negative.

#### Example Process
Suppose you have \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \leq 0 \).

1. **Factor**: \( (x - 2)(x - 3) \leq 0 \).
2. **Find Roots**: Roots are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
3. **Test Intervals**: Check sub-intervals \( (-\infty, 2) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).
   - For \( x = 1 \), both factors negative, product positive.
   - For \( x = 2.5 \), negative times positive, product negative.
   - For \( x = 4 \), both factors positive, product positive.
4. **Solution**: The interval \( x \in [2, 3] \) makes the polynomial less than or equal to zero.

### Study Tips
- Practice is crucial: Work through various problems of each type to solidify strategies.
- Visual aids: Sketch graphs to see how they align with algebraic solutions.
- Break complex problems into smaller parts: Tackle factoring, testing intervals, and graphing one step at a time. 

By focusing on these principles and techniques, you'll be well-prepared to handle polynomial equations and inequalities in the R1 mathematics course.
